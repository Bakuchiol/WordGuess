# Project 1 - Word Duel
Word Duel is inspired by the classic game, Hangman.
In Word Duel, two players act as wizards and each will think of a word that the other will need to guess.
# Project Description
The project task was to make a game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
The rules of the game are:
1. Each player enters their word.
2. Each player has 15 seconds to guess a letter or word.
3. If the guess is wrong, then switch players.
4. Whoever guesses their opponent's word first wins!

# Project lifecycle
Challenges I faced in making this project were the wireframing, pseudocoding, and the actual coding of the gameplay. I watched a tutorial to prepare and better understand the mechanics of the game and translated what I learned to code my own version.  
From the many choices of games to make or recreate, I chose a word guessing game as I was inspired making a game for children.  
The process was challenging but also enjoyable as I learned new methods I was able to implement in the game.
